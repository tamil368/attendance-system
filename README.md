## Working Principle
### 1. **Modules Imported:**
   - `face_recognition`: Used for detecting and encoding faces.
   - `cv2` (OpenCV): For capturing video and displaying the results.
   - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
   - `csv`: To write the attendance logs into a CSV file.
   - `datetime`: To get the current date and time for logging.

### 2. **Camera Initialization:**
   - The camera is initialized using OpenCV (`cv2.VideoCapture(camera)`), where the default camera is set to `0`. If an external camera is used, you can change this value.

### 3. **Loading and Encoding Known Faces:**
   - Several face images (e.g., A, Surjith, Ramprasath, etc.) are loaded using `face_recognition.load_image_file()`.
   - The faces are encoded using `face_recognition.face_encodings()` and stored in a list `known_face_encoding` for later comparison.

### 4. **Known Names:**
   - The names corresponding to the known face encodings are stored in a list `known_faces`. These names are used to identify people when their faces are detected.

### 5. **Attendance Logging:**
   - A CSV file is created with the current date (`data/YYYY-MM-DD.csv`) to log attendance.
   - The program writes the names and the time of detection into the CSV file.

### 6. **Face Detection and Recognition Loop:**
   - The script continuously captures frames from the camera feed.
   - Each frame is resized to 25% of its original size for faster face detection.
   - The frame is converted to RGB since `face_recognition` works with RGB images.
   - Face locations and encodings are extracted from the frame.
   - Each detected face is compared against the known faces using `face_recognition.compare_faces()` and `face_recognition.face_distance()`. The closest match is selected.
   - If the face matches a known person, the name is displayed on the video frame, and their attendance is logged.
   - If the face is not recognized, it is marked as "Unknown Person".

### 7. **Display and Exit:**
   - The script displays the video feed in a window labeled "Attendance System". If a known face is detected, it displays the name along with "Present"; otherwise, it shows "Unknown Person".
   - The loop continues until the user presses the "q" key, at which point the video capture is released, and the window is closed.

### Key Features:
- **Face Matching**: Recognizes and matches faces in real-time.
- **Attendance Logging**: Logs the name and the time of appearance in a CSV file.
- **Efficient Face Detection**: Uses downscaled frames to improve performance without compromising recognition accuracy.
